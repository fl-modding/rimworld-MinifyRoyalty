## A simple mod that makes the items added from Royalty minifiable

Makes item added from Royalty minifiable. I’ve ran into issues with mods that will minify everything in the game. Sometimes they cause major issues like breaking ship parts when used alongside SOS2. So for me this is a way around that, but also to pick/choose what is and isn’t minified.
